# AFWI MAGE Service Mapping - Task 1.1 Completion

## Executive Summary

This service mapping exercise has documented all backend service endpoints, identified usage patterns, and defined routing rules for the AFWI MAGE API Gateway implementation. The gateway will serve as a unified entry point for all client requests, providing consistent authentication, routing, and monitoring across the platform's microservices architecture.

## Key Findings

1. **Service Structure**
   - MAGE consists of 10 primary backend services, each handling specific functionality
   - Services are organized in logical groups (chat, document handling, AI processing)
   - The Core Service acts as a central dependency for most other services

2. **Traffic Patterns**
   - High-traffic services: Chat, Direct Chat, Auth, and Embedding (~85% of traffic)
   - Medium-traffic services:  Agent, Extraction, Core and Upload (~13% of traffic)
   - Low-traffic services: Generation, and Review (~2% of traffic)

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - JWT-based authentication provided by Auth Service
   - Token validation required for most service endpoints
   - Auth Service itself doesn't require authentication (needed for login)

4. **Data Flow**
   - Document processing workflow: Upload → Extraction → Embedding
   - Multi-agent capabilities provided by Agent Service and Chat Service

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Routing Strategy**
   - Use path-based routing to direct requests to appropriate services
   - Implement route-specific middleware chains based on service requirements
   - Configure health checks for critical services like Core and Auth

2. **Authentication Implementation**
   - Use Traefik's ForwardAuth middleware to validate JWT tokens
   - Implement token validation caching to reduce auth service load
   - Allow bypassing authentication in development environments

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Apply rate limiting based on service traffic patterns
   - Implement circuit breaking for service failure isolation
   - Configure retries for critical services
   - Use compression for all responses

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Secure JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times
   - Implement CORS policy to protect against cross-origin attacks
   - Add TLS for production deployments
   - Log all API requests for auditing purposes

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 1**: Finish remaining Analysis & Design tasks
   - Authentication planning (Task 1.2)
   - Gateway architecture design (Task 1.3)
   - Logging strategy (Task 1.4)
   - Testing strategy (Task 1.5)

2. **Prepare for Phase 2**: Gateway Service Implementation
   - Review Traefik configuration with team
   - Test configuration with mock services
   - Plan deployment strategy for the gateway

## Artifacts Created

1. [Service Endpoints Documentation](service_endpoints.md) - Comprehensive mapping of all service endpoints
2. [Service Relationships Diagram](service_relationships.md) - Visual representation of service dependencies
3. [Traefik Configuration Sample](traefik_config.yaml) - Sample gateway configuration for implementation

## Conclusion

The service mapping exercise has provided a solid foundation for the AFWI MAGE API Gateway implementation. The defined routing rules and middleware chains will ensure consistent, secure, and efficient handling of all client requests, while the traffic pattern analysis will guide performance optimization efforts. The next steps will be to implement the authentication strategy and complete the gateway architecture design.
