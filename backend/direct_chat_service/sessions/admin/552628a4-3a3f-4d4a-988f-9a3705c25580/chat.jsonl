First, I need to carefully read through the documents to find any explicit statements about economic goals. \n\nLooking through the documents, there's a section titled \"1. decisively build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way\" which mentions this as a solemn commitment by the Communist Party of China to the people and history.

It mentions that development must respond to people's expectations and safeguard the fundamental interests of the broadest masses.\n\nAdditionally, the document discusses the \"new normal\" of economic development and the shift from high-speed growth to high-quality development. It emphasizes building a modern economic system and promoting high-quality economic development as part of adapting to this new normal.\n\nPutting this all together, the main goals seem to be: building a moderately prosperous society in all aspects, achieving common prosperity, improving people's livelihoods, and transitioning to high-quality development. The context doesn't mention specific GDP targets or laissez-faire markets, instead focusing on quality, efficiency, and meeting people's needs.\n</think>\n\nBased on the provided context, the goals of the PRC's economy are multifaceted and aligned with the broader objectives of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
