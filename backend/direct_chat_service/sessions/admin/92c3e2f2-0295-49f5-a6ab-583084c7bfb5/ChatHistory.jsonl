The user wants me to focus on their long-lasting implications and any societal norms that still exist because of them. Then I have to present this information in a table format for use in a briefing.\n\nFirst, I should list out some major historical events that qualify as the worst. The obvious ones come to mind: World War II, the Holocaust, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, maybe the Vietnam War? Also, perhaps the Rwandan Genocide or the Cambodian Killing Fields. \n\nI need to compare them in terms of scale, duration, casualties, and impact on society. For example, WWII was a global conflict with millions dead, while the Holocaust targeted specific groups systematically. The atomic bombings had immediate effects but also set a precedent for nuclear warfare.\n\nLong-lasting implications could include things like the formation of the United Nations, the establishment of human rights laws, or the ongoing stigma against certain ethnic groups. Societal norms might be things like the taboo against chemical weapons after WWI, or the current international laws against genocide.\n\nI should structure this in a way that's easy to read and compare. A table format with columns for Event, Location, Time Period, Estimated Casualties, Key Atrocities, Long-Term Implications, and Societal Norms would work well. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure the information is accurate. For example, the estimated casualties for each event - I should double-check those numbers. Also, the key atrocities: for WWII, besides the Holocaust, there's also the Nanjing Massacre, the Siege of Leningrad, etc. The Rwandan Genocide had a high death toll relative to its population size.\n\nI need to be careful not to include events that are debatable or less well-documented. Also, make sure the table is concise but informative. Maybe prioritize the most impactful events first in terms of scale and legacy.\n\nAnother thing: some of these events have ongoing implications today. For example, the Vietnam War's impact on U.S. foreign policy, or how the Holocaust led to international human rights frameworks. Societal norms like the ban on chemical weapons after WWI, but then their use again in WWII (like mustard gas) and later in conflicts.\n\nI should also consider cultural impacts - like how certain wars are remembered in literature, film, etc., which affects societal memory. But maybe that's beyond the scope of this particular briefing.\n\nIn terms of structure: start with an introduction explaining the purpose, then present the table with each event as a row, and finally a conclusion summarizing key takeaways. The user mentioned it should be used in a briefing, so clarity and conciseness are important.\n</think>\n\n**Comparison of Major Historical Atrocities**\n\n| **Event**               | **Location**       | **Time Period**      | **Estimated Casualties** | **Key Atrocities**                                                                 | **Long-Term Implications**                                                                                   | **Societal Norms**                          |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **World War II**        | Global             | 1939\u20131945           | ~70 million deaths       | Holocaust (6M Jews), atomic bombings of Hiroshima/Nagasaki, Nanjing Massacre            | Formation of UN, Nuremberg Trials, nuclear non-proliferation treaties                                 | Prohibition on genocide, chemical weapons |\n| **Holocaust**           | Nazi-occupied Europe | 1941\u20131945          | ~6 million Jews          | Systematic extermination via gas chambers, forced labor, starvation                      | International human rights laws, Holocaust education, anti-Semitism awareness campaigns              | Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)|\n| **Vietnam War**         | Vietnam           | 1955\u20131975           | ~2\u20134 million deaths      | Agent Orange defoliation, My Lai Massacre, torture and summary executions                 | End of U.S. military draft, anti-war movements, landmine treaties                                     | Ban on chemical weapons in warfare          |\n| **Rwandan Genocide**    | Rwanda            | 1994                | ~800,000 Tutsis         | Machete attacks, rape as weapon, mass graves                                            | International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), \"Never Again\" genocide prevention efforts        | Responsibility to Protect (UN doctrine)    |\n| **Cambodian Killing Fields** | Cambodia       | 1975\u20131979           | ~1.7 million deaths      | Execution by bayonets/blades, forced labor, starvation                                   | Khmer Rouge Tribunal, landmine ban treaty, refugee crises                                        | Genocide prevention frameworks             |\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- **Scale vs. Intensity:** While WWII had the highest casualty count, events like the Holocaust or Rwandan Genocide were more targeted and systematic.\n- **Legal Frameworks:** Many atrocities directly influenced international law (e.g., Nuremberg Trials, Geneva Conventions).\n- **Technological Impact:** Nuclear weapons and chemical warfare introduced new forms of destruction with lasting psychological effects.\n\nThis table provides a concise overview for briefing purposes.

**Scale vs. Intensity:** While WWII had the highest casualty count, events like the Holocaust or Rwandan Genocide were more targeted and systematic.\n- **Legal Frameworks:** Many atrocities directly influenced international law (e.g., Nuremberg Trials, Geneva Conventions).\n- **Technological Impact:** Nuclear weapons and chemical warfare introduced new forms of destruction with lasting psychological effects.\n\nThese tables provide a concise overview for briefing purposes.
