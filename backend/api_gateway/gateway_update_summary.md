# API Gateway Endpoint Alignment Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the updates made to align the API Gateway configuration with the actual service endpoints. The changes ensure that all services are correctly routed through the gateway based on their documented endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Endpoint Discrepancy Resolutions

| Service | Original Path | Corrected Path | Justification |
|---------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| Embedding | `/api/embedding/*` | `/api/embedding/*` | Verified in code - router prefix is "/api/embedding" |
| Core | `/api/core/*` | `/api/documents/*` and `/` | Matches actual Core service implementation |
| Chat | `/api/chat/*` | Multiple paths: `/chat/*`, `/sessions/*`, etc. | Matches actual Chat service implementation |
| Direct Chat | `/direct-chat/*` | `/api/v1/chat/*` | From config.yaml - prefix is "/api/v1" |
| Extraction | `/api/extraction/*` | `/api/extraction/*` | Verified in app.py - prefix is "/api/extraction" |
| Auth | `/api/auth/*` | `/api/users/*` and `/api/health` | Verified in app.py - prefix is "/api/users" |

### 2. Middleware Refinements

- Removed unnecessary `strip-api-prefix` middleware from routes that don't need path stripping
- Applied specific rate limiting rules based on service usage patterns
- Ensured security headers are consistently applied across all services
- Added retry and circuit breaker capabilities for critical services

### 3. Health Check Standardization

- Updated health check paths to match actual service implementations
- Removed redundant configuration options (port, scheme, hostname)
- Ensured consistent intervals and timeouts across all services

### 4. Test Framework

- Created endpoint validation test suite in `/tests/test_endpoint_validation.py`
- Added test cases for all services to verify routing
- Created documentation for running and extending tests

## Next Steps

### 1. Verification Process

1. Start the API Gateway using the updated configuration:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up api_gateway
   ```

2. Run the endpoint validation tests:
   ```bash
   cd backend/api_gateway/tests
   python test_endpoint_validation.py
   ```

3. Manually verify key endpoints through the gateway:
   - Core service: http://localhost/api/documents
   - Chat service: http://localhost/chat/generate_session_id
   - Auth service: http://localhost/api/users/login
   - Direct Chat: http://localhost/api/v1/chat/sessions
   - Embedding: http://localhost/api/embedding/status

### 2. Pending Tasks

To complete Phase 2.2 (Service Routing Rules), the following tasks remain:

- [ ] Test the updated routing configuration
- [ ] Fix any issues discovered during testing
- [ ] Document the final routing configuration
- [ ] Update the API gateway implementation plan with completion status

### 3. Documentation Updates

The following documentation should be updated to reflect the changes:

- [ ] Update `service_mapping/service_endpoints.md` if any discrepancies are found between documentation and code
- [ ] Update `api-gateway-plan.md` to mark Task 2.2 as completed
- [ ] Document any service-specific considerations in the relevant service READMEs

## Conclusion

The API Gateway configuration has been updated to align with the actual service endpoints based on code examination. The changes ensure consistent routing and authentication across all services. The next step is to test the configuration and verify that all services are accessible through the gateway.

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Standardize Endpoint Patterns**: Consider standardizing endpoint patterns across services (e.g., consistent use of `/api/` prefix)
2. **Health Check Standardization**: Implement a consistent health check endpoint (e.g., `/health`) across all services
3. **Documentation Improvements**: Maintain a centralized API documentation for all services that accurately reflects the implemented endpoints
