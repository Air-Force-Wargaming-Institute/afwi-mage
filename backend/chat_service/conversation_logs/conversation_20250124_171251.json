This report synthesizes the findings from experts across various disciplines to provide a comprehensive overview of the CPC's functions, processes, and limitations.\n\n**Bottom Line Up Front:** The Communist Party of China plays a crucial role in maintaining power through its control over the military, civil administration, and media outlets. However, the exact nature of its influence on China's governance structure remains unclear, with significant information gaps regarding its functions and processes.\n\n**Background Information:** The CPC has been in power since 1949, and its role in governance is multifaceted. The party controls the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which serves as a critical component of China's military strategy. Additionally, the CPC exercises significant influence over civil administration through various agencies, including the State Council and local governments. The party also dominates the media landscape, with state-owned outlets providing extensive coverage of official policies and announcements.\n\n**Discussion:** The CPC's role in governance is complex and multifaceted. While the party maintains control over key institutions, its exact influence on China's governance structure remains unclear. Several pressing information gaps regarding the CPC's functions and processes were identified:\n\n* What exactly is the role of the Communist Party in working joint civil-military issues?\n* Does the CPC have separate authority to negotiate with civilian agencies that impinge on the PLA's equities?\n\nThese questions are critical in understanding China's governance structure and its implications for regional and global security. The report highlights the importance of clarifying the CPC's role in negotiating with other agencies, as this can have significant implications for the PLA's operations and effectiveness.\n\n**Overarching Trends:** Several overarching trends emerge from the expert reports:\n\n* The CPC's control over key institutions, including the PLA and civil administration, is critical to its maintenance of power.\n* Significant information gaps regarding the CPC's functions and processes remain, particularly in areas where there are implications for regional and global security.\n* International partners must engage with Chinese officials to clarify the CPC's role in governance, particularly in areas where there are significant implications for regional and global security.\n\n**Conflicting Viewpoints:** Conflicting viewpoints emerge from the expert reports:\n\n* Some experts argue that the CPC's control over key institutions is sufficient to maintain its power, while others suggest that information gaps regarding the party's functions and processes remain a critical concern.\n* Military analysts emphasize the importance of clarifying the CPC's role in working joint civil-military issues, while economic analysts highlight the need for greater transparency in the party's governance structure.\n\n**Conclusion/Recommendations:** This report provides a comprehensive overview of the Communist Party of China's role in maintaining power since 1949. To address the pressing information gaps regarding the CPC's functions and processes, we recommend that:\n\n* The Chinese government provide clear and transparent information about the CPC's role in governance.\n* International partners engage with Chinese officials to clarify the CPC's functions and processes, particularly in areas where there are significant implications for regional and global security.\n* Future research focus on understanding the complexities of China's governance structure and its implications for regional and global security.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1. \"The PRC Military-Civil Integration Development Law\" (《中华人民共和国军民融合发展法》), May 2020.\n2. \"Annual Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China,\" Office of the Secretary of Defense, May 2019.\n3. \"What does China really spend on its military?\" China Power - CSIS, accessed March 2020.\n\nNote: This report synthesizes the findings from experts across various disciplines to provide a comprehensive overview of the Communist Party of China's role in maintaining power since 1949.
