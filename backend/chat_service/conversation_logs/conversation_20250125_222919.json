The relationship between the two has been marked by tensions, with the PRC seeking to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and economically, while Taiwan seeks to maintain its independence and engage in international trade.\n\n**Economic Ties**\n\nThe PRC's economic ties with Taiwan are significant, with China being one of Taiwan's largest trading partners. In 2020, bilateral trade between the two reached $141 billion, with Chinese exports accounting for approximately 60% of total trade. However, the relationship is also marked by restrictions and limitations, including the PRC's \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy, which limits Taiwanese participation in mainland China's economy.\n\n**Taiwanese Economic Interests**\n\nTaiwan's economic interests are closely tied to its relationships with other countries, particularly the United States. Taiwan has sought to maintain a strong relationship with the US, which provides significant military and economic support. In 2020, bilateral trade between Taiwan and the US reached $73 billion, with Taiwanese exports accounting for approximately 20% of total trade.\n\n**PRC's Economic Strategy**\n\nThe PRC's economic strategy towards Taiwan is multifaceted, including:\n\n1. **Economic Pressure**: The PRC has sought to use economic pressure to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and economically.\n2. **Investment and Trade**: China has invested heavily in Taiwan, with significant infrastructure projects and trade agreements.\n3. **Technological Advancement**: The PRC seeks to advance its technological capabilities, including in the areas of artificial intelligence, 5G, and renewable energy.\n\n**Regional Implications**\n\nThe PRC-Taiwan relationship has significant implications for regional stability, global trade, and technological advancement. The competition between China and Taiwan for influence and dominance in the region is driving a new era of great power rivalry, with significant implications for security, trade, and technology.\n\n**Global Implications**\n\nThe PRC-Taiwan relationship also has significant global implications, including:\n\n1. **Trade and Investment**: The relationship has significant implications for global trade and investment, particularly in the areas of technology and infrastructure.\n2. **Security and Stability**: The competition between China and Taiwan for influence and dominance in the region is driving a new era of great power rivalry, with significant implications for security and stability.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, the PRC's economic ties with Taiwan are complex and multifaceted, with significant implications for regional stability, global trade, and technological advancement. The competition between China and Taiwan for influence and dominance in the region is driving a new era of great power rivalry, with significant implications for security, trade, and technology.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nBased on this analysis, we recommend:\n\n1. **Strengthening Diplomatic Relations**: Strengthening diplomatic relations between Taiwan and other countries, particularly the US, to promote regional stability and cooperation.\n2. **Promoting Economic Cooperation**: Promoting economic cooperation between Taiwan and other countries, particularly in the areas of technology and infrastructure.\n3. **Addressing Security Concerns**: Addressing security concerns related to the PRC-Taiwan relationship, including the use of military force and cyber attacks.\n\nSources:\n\n* \"Taiwan Strait: 21 July 1995 to 23 March 1996,\" globalsecurity.com (no date)\n* Heather Smith and Stuart Harris, \"Economic Relations Across the Strait: Interdependence or Dependence?\" (1997)\n* U.S. Department of State, \"2020 National Defense Strategy\" (2020)\n* \"PRC Background Guide: Third Draft\" (2019)\n* British Broadcasting Corporation, \"Russian Purchases Boost China's Air Strength\" (1999)",
