# Vector Store Update Debugging Plan

## Issue Summary
We've identified that vector store creation works correctly, but vector store updates are failing with the error "Error updating vector store [id]". This issue needs to be resolved to ensure complete functionality of the embedding service.

## Debugging Approach

### 1. Analyze the Error Source

- [x] Inspect the `process_vectorstore_update` function in `app.py` to understand the update flow
- [ ] Add more detailed logging in the update function to pinpoint the exact failure point
- [ ] Check the parameters passed from the `update_vectorstore` endpoint to the background task
- [ ] Verify consistency between the `UpdateVectorStoreRequest` model and the implementation

### 2. Test Step-by-Step Execution

- [ ] Modify the test script to include detailed logging at each step of the update process
- [ ] Test with a single small file to minimize complexity
- [ ] Monitor each stage of the update process:
  - [ ] File copying to staging
  - [ ] Document loading and chunking
  - [ ] Embedding generation
  - [ ] Vector store updating

### 3. Check Specific Areas

#### File Handling
- [ ] Verify file paths are correctly processed (absolute vs. relative paths)
- [ ] Check if files are properly being copied to the staging directory
- [ ] Ensure file permissions are correct

#### Document Processing
- [ ] Check document loading from the staged files
- [ ] Verify chunking parameters are correctly used
- [ ] Ensure document metadata is properly extracted and processed

#### Embedding Generation
- [ ] Verify the embedding model is correctly initialized
- [ ] Check if embeddings are being generated for the new documents
- [ ] Test with different embedding models

#### Vector Store Update
- [ ] Examine the `update_vectorstore` method in the `VectorStoreManager` class
- [ ] Verify FAISS index updating logic
- [ ] Check metadata updating process

### 4. Compare with Creation Process

- [ ] Compare the document processing in the update function with the creation function
- [ ] Identify differences in parameter handling and data flow
- [ ] Check if any parameters required for update are missing or handled differently

### 5. Fix Implementation

Based on findings, implement fixes focusing on:

- [ ] Parameter consistency between API models and implementation
- [ ] Error handling and reporting
- [ ] Data validation at each step
- [ ] Proper resource management

### 6. Testing Plan

- [ ] Test with various file types (txt, pdf, docx)
- [ ] Test with different file sizes
- [ ] Test with various numbers of files (single file, multiple files)
- [ ] Test with different embedding models
- [ ] Verify error handling in edge cases:
  - [ ] Empty files
  - [ ] Very large files
  - [ ] Invalid files
  - [ ] Non-existent vector store IDs

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Day 1**: In-depth analysis and adding detailed logging
2. **Day 2**: Implement fixes based on analysis
3. **Day 3**: Comprehensive testing and validation
4. **Day 4**: Documentation and integration with other components

## Expected Outcome

- Vector store updates work correctly for all file types and sizes
- Proper error handling and reporting for failed updates
- Clear documentation of the update process and API
- Stable and reliable update functionality ready for frontend integration
