  "roadToWar": "Background:\nIn 2027, the global security landscape fractures. In the Indo-Pacific, the Chinese Communist Party accelerates pressure on Taiwan through aggressive naval maneuvers and \u201cgrey zone\u201d operations. A disputed Taiwanese coast guard incident spirals into blockade conditions.\n\nSimultaneously, in Europe, Russia initiates a surprise buildup along NATO\u2019s northeastern frontier, exploiting a contested political transition in Latvia. False-flag provocations stir unrest in Daugavpils and Narva, backed by covert Wagner-style actors.\n\nWashington faces an impossible dilemma: divide forces, or risk giving up initiative in one theater. North Korea and Iran sense the moment and begin missile demonstrations, testing air defenses and alliance cohesion.\n\nKey Actors & Starting Posture:\nUnited States:\nGlobal alert posture. INDOPACOM has carrier strike groups near Taiwan; EUCOM scrambles rapid reaction forces. Cyber and space assets stretched across both AORs. Interagency crisis cells activated.\n\nChina (PRC):\nPLA Navy postures near Taiwan Strait. Strategic ambiguity is leveraged; no full mobilization declared. Political messaging suggests \u201cTaiwan's reintegration is inevitable.\u201d\n\nRussia:\nForce posture ambiguous\u2014\u201ctraining exercises\u201d near Latvia. Political provocations push Baltic governments to request NATO rapid deployment. Russian media fuels ethnic tensions.\n\nNATO/EU Allies:\nDeep concern, but varying political will. The Baltics, Poland, and the UK advocate firm response. Southern Europe pushes for diplomatic caution.\n\nTaiwan:\nUnder economic and cyber siege. Mobilizes reserves and hardens coastal defenses. Public morale high but wavering.\n\nNational Objectives:\nUnited States:\nPrevent adversary gains in either theater without overextension. Demonstrate global command agility and uphold alliance credibility.\n\nChina:\nAdvance Taiwan reunification agenda without sparking US kinetic engagement. Shape global narrative in China's favor.\n\nRussia:\nTest NATO resolve, peel off weaker states diplomatically, and reclaim influence in the Baltics.\n\nNATO/Taiwan:\nPrevent war, maintain sovereignty, and sustain alliance unity under high pressure.\n\nDIME Integration:\nDiplomacy: UN Security Council paralyzed. US initiates bilateral engagements with Japan, UK, Germany. NATO Council convened in emergency session.\n\nInformation: Coordinated propaganda from Russia and China. AI-generated forgeries and deepfakes accelerate confusion.\n\nMilitary: Competing demands on global ISR, lift capacity, and C2 bandwidth. Pressure to prioritize one theater risks losing the other.\n\nEconomic: Sanctions and export controls tighten. Global markets rattle; energy and semiconductor disruptions begin.",
