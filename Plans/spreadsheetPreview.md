### Error Handling
- [x] Gracefully handle loading errors with meaningful messages
- [x] Provide fallback for unsupported spreadsheet features
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed data loading
- [x] Include error boundary to prevent complete UI failures

## Implementation Strategy

### Component Structure
1. `SpreadsheetModal` (container) ✅
   - Manages modal state, sheet loading, and view settings
2. `SheetTabs` (navigation) ✅
   - Handles switching between sheets
3. `SpreadsheetGrid` (data display) ✅
   - Virtualized grid for efficient rendering
4. `SpreadsheetControls` (toolbar) ✅
   - Contains search, filter, view options

### Data Management
1. Use progressive loading pattern: ✅
   - Initial load: First 100 rows of active sheet
   - Scroll-based loading: Load additional chunks as user scrolls (Implemented with pagination)
   - Background loading: Pre-fetch other sheets when idle (Not implemented yet)

2. Implement a state management approach: ✅
   - Track loaded data by sheet and chunk
   - Cache previously viewed sheets
   - Implement memory limits with LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy for very large files (Not implemented yet)

### API Enhancements
- [x] Modify backend API to support partial data loading (pagination, chunking)
- [ ] Add endpoint for sheet statistics and metadata without full data
- [ ] Implement column data type detection API for smarter rendering
- [ ] Add search/filter capabilities on the backend for large datasets

## Testing Considerations
- [ ] Test with various spreadsheet sizes (small, medium, large)
- [ ] Test with different types of data (text, numeric, dates, formulas)
- [ ] Verify memory usage with very large spreadsheets
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation and accessibility
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works on various screen sizes

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
- [ ] Add simple edit functionality for cell values
- [ ] Implement column/row hiding
- [ ] Add comment/annotation capabilities
- [ ] Create snapshot/versioning feature
- [ ] Support formula evaluation and display
- [ ] Add data quality indicators (missing values, outliers)
- [ ] Implement conditional formatting based on values

## Accessibility Considerations
- [x] Ensure keyboard navigability of all features
- [ ] Add appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers
- [x] Ensure sufficient color contrast for all UI elements
- [ ] Support text scaling for users with visual impairments
- [x] Add hover tooltips for additional information

## Progress Notes
