# Record & Transcribe Live Feature Implementation Plan

## Implementation Progress
**Frontend Progress**: 70% Complete ‚úÖ  
**Backend Progress**: 0% Complete ‚è≥  
**Overall Progress**: 35% Complete üöÄ

**Current Status**: Frontend UI implementation is complete with all core components, styling, and basic functionality in place. The application can record audio, visualize waveforms, and simulate transcription. Backend API implementation is needed for actual transcription functionality.

**Next Priorities**:
1. Backend API implementation for transcription service
2. WebSocket integration for real-time updates
3. Finalize military-specific output formats
4. Implement advanced wargame-specific features

## Overview
This plan outlines the development of a new "Record & Transcribe Live" feature within the Document Library component. The feature will allow users to record audio directly from their computer and receive real-time transcription in a dedicated browser window while preserving the MAGE application styling. This tool is specifically enhanced for wargaming scenarios, military exercises, and senior leader sessions.

- Test MediaRecorder API support and provide fallback options
- Handle browser-specific audio format limitations

### Performance Optimization
- Implement efficient audio compression before sending to server
- Use Web Workers for audio processing to prevent UI thread blocking
- Optimize waveform rendering for smooth performance
- Consider chunking approach for both audio data and transcription updates
- Implement progressive loading for long transcription sessions

### Security Considerations
- Ensure secure WebSocket connections for audio streaming
- Implement proper authorization for API endpoints
- Consider adding microphone permission handling with clear user instructions
- Add appropriate content security policy headers
- Implement classification handling and marking throughout the system
- Ensure secure storage of classified materials

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation support for all controls
- Add proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Include visual indicators alongside audio cues
- Ensure color contrast compliance
- Provide alternative text for all visual markers and timelines

### Military Environment Considerations
- Implement bandwidth efficiency for constrained networks
- Ensure operation in environments with limited connectivity
- Support classification markers at multiple levels
- Comply with military data handling requirements

## Next Steps
1. ~~Create basic UI mockup of the RecordTranscribe component with wargaming-specific elements~~
2. ~~Implement the UI with dummy data and participant management~~
3. ~~Integrate audio recording functionality with multi-speaker support~~
4. ~~Implement timeline markers and observer annotation system~~
5. ~~Set up WebSocket connection structure (to be connected to backend later)~~
6. ~~Implement window management and warning dialogs~~
7. ~~Add styling to match MAGE application theme~~
8. ~~Create classification handling and marking system~~
9. Create military-standard output format templates
10. Prepare documentation for backend team with API requirements

## Open Questions
- What is the maximum recording duration that should be supported?
- Are there specific audio quality requirements (bitrate, channels, etc.)?
- Should users be able to save partial transcriptions before finalizing?
- What classification levels need to be supported?
- What military reporting formats should be prioritized?
- How will speaker voice signatures be stored securely?
- What level of offline functionality is required for disconnected operations?
- Are there specific military acronyms or terminology libraries that should be integrated?
