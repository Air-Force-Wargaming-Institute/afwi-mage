# Report Builder: Config Panel Parent-Child Functionality

## 1. Goal

To enhance the Report Configuration Panel by introducing a parent-child relationship between "Sections" (parents) and "Elements" (children). This will improve the organization and management of report components, requiring updates to both frontend and backend systems.

## 2. Core Concepts

*   **Section (Parent):** A new organizational unit in the report structure. Sections group related Elements.
*   **Element (Child):** Existing report components that will now be hierarchically linked to a parent Section.
*   **Parent UUID:** A unique identifier on Element data models that links an Element to its parent Section. Elements not part of a Section will have a null `parent_uuid`.
*   **Ordering:** Child Elements will always maintain their order under their parent Section. Sections themselves can be reordered, and their children will move with them.
*   **Section Visibility:** Sections are an organizational tool for the configuration panel (left side) only. They will *not* be directly visible in the report preview panel (right side).
*   **Section Export Behavior:**
    *   **JSON & Markdown Exports:** Sections (and their parent-child relationships with Elements) WILL be represented in these export formats.
    *   **HTML, TXT, PDF, & Word Exports:** Sections WILL NOT be represented. The output will be a flattened list of Elements as if Sections were not present, maintaining the order of Elements.

## 3. General understandings of User desires

**Backend Modifications:**

*   ** Story:** As a developer, I need to update the backend data models for reports and templates to support a parent-child hierarchy.
    *    **Task:** Add a `parent_uuid` field to the Element data model (or equivalent) in the database schema.
    *    **Task:** Ensure API endpoints for creating/updating reports and templates can handle the new `parent_uuid` field for Elements.
    *    **Task:** Modify API endpoints for fetching report/template structures to include `parent_uuid` information for Elements.

**Frontend - Config Panel UI & Logic:**

*   ** Story:** As a user, I want to visually distinguish Sections from Elements in the config panel.
    *    **Task:** Design and implement a distinct visual representation for Sections in the `ReportConfigPanel.js`.
    *    **Task:** Ensure Elements are visually nested or clearly associated with their parent Section.

*   ** Story:** As a user, I want the report saving functionality to accurately store the new parent-child relationships between Sections and Elements, so my organized report structure is preserved and can be reloaded correctly.
    *    **Task:** Verify and update the save functionality (likely in `ReportDesignerPage.js` or a related service) to correctly serialize the `items` array (containing both Sections and Elements with `parent_uuid` and `elements` for Sections) when sending data to the backend.
    *    **Task:** Ensure the frontend correctly processes the backend's response after saving, particularly if new IDs or timestamps are generated for sections or elements.
    *    **Task:** Thoroughly test the save and reload process for reports with various configurations:
        *   Reports with multiple sections and nested elements.
        *   Reports with a mix of parented and unparented elements.
        *   Reports where sections might be reordered.
        *   Edge cases, such as saving immediately after section/element creation or deletion.

*   ** Story:** As a user, I want to manage Sections and their Elements effectively using intuitive controls.
    *   **Task:** Implement "Add Section to the End" button on the left of the config panel.
    *   **Task:** Move the "Add Element to End" button to the right of the config panel.
    *   **Task:** Implement "Insert Section Below" button, likely at the bottom of each Section or at the end of the list, on the far left.
    *   **Task:** Modify the "Insert Element Below" button:
        *   Move it to the far right, within the Element's display area.
        *   If an Element is within a Section, "Insert Element Below" should add the new Element within the same parent Section.
    *   **Task:** Implement functionality to collapse/expand a Parent Section, which should correspondingly collapse/expand its child Elements.

*   ** Story:** As a user, I want to be able to reorder Sections and have their child Elements move with them.
    *   **Task:** Implement drag-and-drop or button-based reordering for Sections within the config panel.
    *   **Task:** Ensure that when a Section is moved, all its child Elements move with it, maintaining their relative order.

*   ** Story:** As a user, I want Sections to always contain at least one Element.
    *   **Task:** When a new Section is created, if no Element is immediately added by the user, automatically insert a new Element within that Section. This Element will be created with the application's standard default values for new elements, and its `parent_uuid` will be set to the ID of the newly created Section.
    *   **Task:** If the last Element of a Section is deleted, automatically insert a new Element within that Section. This Element will be created with the application's standard default values for new elements, and its `parent_uuid` will be set to the ID of the parent Section.

*   ** Story:** As a user, I want to manage the relationship between Elements and Sections.
    *   **Task:** Implement a user-friendly button/action for Elements without a `parent_uuid` to be added into the Section directly above them (if one exists). Disable this option if no Section is above.
    *   **Task:** Implement functionality for an Element with a `parent_uuid` to be removed from its parent Section. The removed Element should be placed directly below the last Element of its former parent Section in the overall list (its `parent_uuid` becomes null).
    *   **Task:** When a parent Section is deleted, all its child Elements will have their `parent_uuid` set to null and become unparented, remaining in the report structure in their current order relative to other elements/sections.

*   ** Story:** As a user, I want clear rules for how Sections and Elements interact, ensuring data integrity and ease of use (e.g., Sections always have content, Elements can be moved between Sections or become independent).**
    *    **Element-Section Association Logic:**
        *    Implement logic for the "add to section above" button for unparented Elements.
        *    Implement logic for "remove from parent section" button for parented Elements (element becomes unparented and moves below its former section).
    *    **Section Content & Deletion Rules:**
        *    When a parent Section is deleted, all its child Elements will have their `parent_uuid` set to `null` and become unparented, remaining in the report structure.
        *    Enforce the "Section must have at least one child" rule (by adding a new standard-default element with its `parent_uuid` appropriately set on Section creation or when the last child is deleted).

*   ** Story: As a user, I want to be able to rename sections in the config panel to better organize my report.**
    *   **Section Renaming Logic:**
        *   **Task:** Implement UI for inline editing or a rename button for Section titles in `ReportConfigPanel.js`.
        *   **Task:** Update state management (`handleElementChange` or a new section-specific handler) to reflect section title changes in the section object within the main flat `items` list.
        *   **Task:** Ensure section title changes are persisted correctly when the report is saved (verify backend handles section title updates).

*   ** Story: As a user, I want to delete a section, and its child elements should become unparented and remain in the report, so I don't lose content unintentionally.** (Refines existing deletion logic)
    *   **Section Deletion - Child Handling:**
        *   **Task:** Implement UI for a "Delete Section" button in `ReportConfigPanel.js` (if not already satisfactory).
        *   **Task:** Refine `handleDeleteItem` for sections in `ReportConfigPanel.js`:
            *   Identify all child elements of the deleted section (e.g., from its `elements` array or by filtering the flat list by `parent_uuid`).
            *   For each corresponding child element in the main flat `items` list, set its `parent_uuid` to `null`.
            *   Remove the section object from the main flat `items` list.
            *   Ensure the (now unparented) child elements are correctly positioned in the main flat `items` list (e.g., placed where the section was, maintaining their internal order).

*   ** Story: As a user, I expect to edit all properties (title, content, type, format, etc.) of an element seamlessly, whether it is a top-level element or nested within a section.** (Clarification for robust editing)
    *   **In-Section Element Editing:**
        *   **Task:** Review and debug `handleElementChange`, `handleTitleClick`, `saveTitleChange` in `ReportConfigPanel.js` to ensure they correctly update child elements by:
            *   Modifying the element's properties in the main flat `items` list.
            *   Crucially, also modifying the properties of the corresponding element object within its parent section's `elements` array to ensure UI consistency (if dual state management is maintained).
        *   **Task:** Verify that rich text editor and other editing modals function correctly for elements within sections.

*   ** Story: As a user, I want to easily remove an element from its parent section, making it a top-level element, so I can restructure my report.** (Clarification for robust removal)
    *   **Remove Element From Section - Robustness:**
        *   **Task:** Review and debug the "Remove from Section" button logic (`handleRemoveElementFromSection`) in `ReportConfigPanel.js` to ensure:
            *   The element's `parent_uuid` in the main flat `items` list is set to `null`.
            *   The element is removed from its former parent section's `elements` array (if dual state management is maintained).
            *   The element is correctly positioned as a top-level item in the main flat `items` list (e.g., appearing below its former parent section).
            *   If the parent section becomes empty as a result, a new default child element is correctly added to that section's `elements` array AND to the main flat `items` list (with the correct `parent_uuid` linking it to the section).

*   ** Story:** As a user, I expect the report preview panel to accurately display a flattened, correctly ordered list of all elements from the report, regardless of their section organization in the configuration panel.**
    *   **Preview Panel Accuracy:**
        *   **Task:** Verify that `ReportPreviewPanel.js` (and any data transformation logic feeding into it) correctly processes the `definition.items` from `ReportDesignerPage.js`.
            *   This involves extracting all items with `item_type: 'element'` from the main flat `items` list.
            *   Ensuring these elements are displayed in the order they appear in the main flat `items` list, which should reflect their true visual/logical order.
            *   Confirming that items with `item_type: 'section'` are not themselves rendered in the preview.

## 4. High-Level Implementation Plan & Checklist & User Stories

**Phase 1: Backend Changes (`report_builder_service`)**

*   **User Story (Developer): As a developer, I need to update the backend system to support 'Sections' as parents of 'Elements' (including data storage, APIs, and varied export logic) to enable richer report organization for users.**
    *   [x] **Data Model Update:**
        *   [x] Modify database schema (e.g., `models.py` or similar) to add `parent_uuid` (or equivalent, e.g., `section_id`) to the Element table/model. This field can be nullable.
        *   [x] Define `Section` model in schemas and update `ReportContent` to include `Union[Section, ReportElement]` in its `items` list.
    *   [x] **API Endpoint Updates (`api/` routes):** (Partially addressed by Pydantic, logic review needed)
        *   [x] Update `POST /reports` and `POST /templates` (and their PUT equivalents) to accept the new `content.items` structure which includes Sections and Elements. (Verified: Pydantic models and existing logic in `api/reports.py` and `api/templates.py` handle this.)
        *   [x] Update `GET /reports/{id}` and `GET /templates/{id}` to return the new `content.items` structure. (Verified: Loading into Pydantic models and FastAPI serialization in `api/reports.py` and `api/templates.py` handle this.)
        *   [x] Ensure report/template creation and update logic correctly handles ordering of elements within sections and sections themselves. (Verified: Order is based on client payload for `POST` and `PUT` operations in `api/reports.py` and `api/templates.py`.)
    *   [x] **Service Logic (`services/`):**
        *   [x] Update `init_templates.py` if default templates need to reflect the new Section/Element structure.
        *   [x] Modify any service-level logic that processes report structures to be aware of the parent-child relationships. (e.g., export, generation)
        *   [x] Update export generation logic (for HTML, TXT, PDF, Word) to exclude Section information, presenting a flattened list of Elements. Ensure JSON and Markdown exports retain Section information.

## 5. Open Questions & Discussion Points

The following points have been clarified based on recent feedback:

*   **Section Empty State:** If a Section's last Element is deleted, an empty Element will be automatically added to that Section. Sections should not be empty.
*   **Section Deletion Impact on Children:** When a parent Section is deleted, its child Elements will have their `parent_uuid` set to `null`. They will become unparented and remain in the report structure, maintaining their order relative to other top-level items. They are *not* deleted with the section.
*   **Handling Legacy Reports (Pre-Sections):** Elements in existing reports created before this parent-child functionality will implicitly have a null `parent_uuid`. They will be treated as top-level, unparented Elements. No special data migration is required for these older reports, but the system must gracefully handle null `parent_uuid`s from the outset for all elements.
*   **Element Placement After Removal From Section:** When an Element is removed from a parent Section, its `parent_uuid` becomes `null`, and it is placed in the overall list of elements (in the config panel). Its new position will be immediately following all the elements that were part of its former parent Section.

This revised plan should provide a clearer structure for implementation. Please let me know if there are any misunderstandings of your desires.
