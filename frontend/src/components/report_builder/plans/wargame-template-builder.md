We are going to make a new template that will be a part of the @init_templates.py, the title will be "CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMANDER’S SITUATION REPORT" and will include the following information. 
An overall Template title element that default's to "Wargame SITREP" with the Description of "The Commander’s SITREP is a multipurpose, narrative report submitted
IAW United States Message Text Format (USMTF) instructions found in
reference (c). It keeps addressees informed and enables the commands and
Services concerned to expect and prepare for potential occurrences. Message
instructions in reference (c) identify unit (tactical)-level SITREP information
requirements as well as the CJCS-level content requirements. Current as of 28 Feburary 2025"

C:\Users\Administrator\MAGE\afwi-multi-agent-generative-engine\backend\report_builder_service\init_templates.py
There will be ten sections, each with two elements. A title element and a content element. 
The titles will be the following (without the numbering)
(1) Own situation, disposition, and/or status of forces.
 (2) Situation overview.
 (3) Operations.
 (4) Critical assets.
 (5) Intelligence and reconnaissance.
 (6) Logistics.
 (7) Communications and connectivity.
 (8) Personnel.
 (9) Significant political, military, and diplomatic events.
 (10) Commander’s evaluation and/or CCDR’s assessment. 

Get the content for these sections from the following 

(1) Own Situation, Disposition, and/or Status of Forces. Includes
summary updating changes to (or not previously reported) major combatant
and support forces, equipment, and critical supplies and their locations; status
of deployment; completion of transportation closure; status, progress, and
completion of joint reception, staging, onward movement, and integration
(JRSOI); significant degradation in unit mission readiness; current
deployments; proposed deployments (to include concept of operations for
deployment if not previously provided); changes in task force designations,
organization, or change of operational control; and projected requirements for
additional forces. In addressing the status of deployment, updates should be
keyed to major forces (combatant and support forces) as outlined in the
approved execute order (EXORD), deployment order (DEPORD), and
modifications to EXORDs and/or DEPORDs. Comments should provide an
update on their deployment status and location, to include updates on the
JRSOI process. Final comments will be the commander’s declaration that the unit is operationally ready and an overall assessment of operational and/or
combat capability in the joint area of operations.
 (2) Situation Overview. Provide a brief overall assessment of the
situation, including circumstances or conditions that increase, or materially
detract from, the capability and readiness of forces assigned or under
operational control of the command or Service.
 (3) Operations. A brief description and the results of combat
operations carried out by major combatant elements during the reporting
period, information on allied forces’ operations, a summary of plans for combat
operations during the next 24 hours (including objectives and probable enemy
reaction), and deviations or variations from previously reported intentions or
plans.
 (4) Critical Assets. Report the loss, incapacitation, or disruption of a
Defense Critical Infrastructure (DCI) Task Critical Asset (TCA), which could
result in mission failure at the CCMD or sub-unified command level.
Paragraph 13.b of reference (a) requires CCDRs to take such actions only at
SecDef direction, with narrow exceptions, and to report any action taken to the
NMCC. The report should describe the TCA’s actual impact upon the CCMD
and/or sub-unified command mission. A list of assets critical to each CCMD
or sub-unified command is maintained by command’s associated DCI office,
normally within the Directorate for Operations, J-3.
 (5) Intelligence and Reconnaissance. A brief overview of the situation,
including operations, order of battle, capabilities, and threat changes, and
references to any significant intelligence reporting submitted in the previous 24
hours.
 (6) Logistics. Provide a logistics supportability analyses dealing with all
joint logistics capability areas (JCAs) (deployment and distribution, supply and
maintenance, logistics services, health service support, operational contracting,
and operational engineering) ensuring identification of deficiencies affecting the
support of planned operations beyond the commander’s and Service’s
capability to mitigate in a timely manner.
 (7) Communication and Connectivity. Significant outages, quantitative
equipment deficiencies, secure interoperable equipment incompatibilities,
traffic volume, etc. Also, provide an assessment of the mission impact caused
by any C4 degradation or network outage. unit is operationally ready and an overall assessment of operational and/or
combat capability in the joint area of operations.
 (2) Situation Overview. Provide a brief overall assessment of the
situation, including circumstances or conditions that increase, or materially
detract from, the capability and readiness of forces assigned or under
operational control of the command or Service.
 (3) Operations. A brief description and the results of combat
operations carried out by major combatant elements during the reporting
period, information on allied forces’ operations, a summary of plans for combat
operations during the next 24 hours (including objectives and probable enemy
reaction), and deviations or variations from previously reported intentions or
plans.

Defense Critical Infrastructure (DCI) Task Critical Asset (TCA), which could
result in mission failure at the CCMD or sub-unified command level.
Paragraph 13.b of reference (a) requires CCDRs to take such actions only at
SecDef direction, with narrow exceptions, and to report any action taken to the
NMCC. The report should describe the TCA’s actual impact upon the CCMD
and/or sub-unified command mission. A list of assets critical to each CCMD
or sub-unified command is maintained by command’s associated DCI office,
normally within the Directorate for Operations, J-3.
 (5) Intelligence and Reconnaissance. A brief overview of the situation,
including operations, order of battle, capabilities, and threat changes, and
references to any significant intelligence reporting submitted in the previous 24
hours.
 (6) Logistics. Provide a logistics supportability analyses dealing with all
joint logistics capability areas (JCAs) (deployment and distribution, supply and
maintenance, logistics services, health service support, operational contracting,
and operational engineering) ensuring identification of deficiencies affecting the
support of planned operations beyond the commander’s and Service’s
capability to mitigate in a timely manner.
 (7) Communication and Connectivity. Significant outages, quantitative
equipment deficiencies, secure interoperable equipment incompatibilities,
traffic volume, etc. Also, provide an assessment of the mission impact caused
by any C4 degradation or network outage. (8) Personnel. Factors affecting readiness of forces or units,
mobilization status, the number of daily battle casualties (i.e., killed in action,
wounded in action, and missing in action) aggregated by Service and the effect
of all casualties sustained (i.e., battle, non-battle, critical skills, key personnel)
on the command’s mission capability; or, upon occurrence of a natural or
manmade disaster, any degradation in capability or negative impact on mission
readiness, and the magnitude of injury or death to DoD affiliated personnel.
Total troop strength is tabulated, including data on military, civilian, and
contractor personnel physically present in a geographic CCDR’s area of
responsibility or a subordinate joint force commander’s joint operations area.
Use joint personnel status report format in reference (b).
 (9) Significant Political, Military, and Diplomatic Events. Events not
reported by OPREP-3 PINNACLE that could result in local, national, or
international public reaction; results and decisions of key allied or other foreign
government meetings; civil unrest or indications of civil defense measures

of key points from subparagraphs 8.a.(1) through 8.a.(8) highlighting areas
requiring Presidential, SecDef, and/or CJCS action or decisions and continuity
of operations plans implementation or intentions on execution. If not
previously addressed, this section will include the commander’s assessment of
operational and/or combatant capability in theater. Comments will provide an
overall assessment and individual comments keyed to major forces (combatant
and support forces) as outlined in the approved EXORD, DEPORD, and/or
their modifications.
 b. SITREPs should highlight key activities and build on previous reports.
Duplicating information in SITREPs by other commanders is not desirable, nor
is including information solely to “fill the blocks.” Significant information
already reported in other JRS reports should be referenced, not repeated.
Brevity is paramount. All changes from previous SITREPs must be annotated
with a date time group of the change.
